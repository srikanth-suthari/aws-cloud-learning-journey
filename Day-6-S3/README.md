## Day 6: Amazon S3 & Data Transfer Deep Dive ðŸš€

> **Today's Focus:** Mastering object storage with Amazon S3 and exploring AWS's physical and hybrid data transfer solutions.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

-   **S3 Buckets:** These are the fundamental containers for data in S3. Each bucket must have a **globally unique name** and is created in a specific AWS Region.

-   **S3 Versioning:** A crucial safety feature. When enabled, it preserves every version of every object, protecting against accidental overwrites and deletions. You can restore previous versions of an object at any time.

-   **S3 Encryption:** Data can be secured both in transit (using SSL/TLS) and at rest. Server-Side Encryption (SSE) options include **SSE-S3** (AWS manages the keys), **SSE-KMS** (you manage keys via AWS KMS), and **SSE-C** (you provide your own keys).

-   **Static Website Hosting:** A simple and powerful feature that allows you to serve a static website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) directly from an S3 bucket, making it highly available and scalable at a low cost.

-   **S3 Bucket Policies:** JSON-based policies attached to a bucket to grant permissions to users and accounts. They are a powerful way to manage access to all objects within a single bucket.

-   **S3 Replication (CRR & SRR):**
    -   **Cross-Region Replication (CRR):** Automatically copies objects to a bucket in a different AWS Region. Used for disaster recovery and reducing latency for users in different geographic locations.
    -   **Same-Region Replication (SRR):** Copies objects to another bucket in the *same* AWS Region. Used for aggregating logs or creating separate development/production accounts.

-   **S3 Storage Classes:** Different tiers of storage that balance cost against retrieval time and availability. Choosing the right class is key to optimizing costs.
    -   `S3 Standard`
    -   `S3 Intelligent-Tiering`
    -   `S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)`
    -   `S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)`
    -   `S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval`
    -   `S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval`
    -   `S3 Glacier Deep Archive`

-   **AWS Snow Family (Snowball):** A service that uses physical devices to transfer petabyte-scale data into and out of AWS. It's ideal when network transfer would be too slow or expensive.

-   **AWS Storage Gateway:** A hybrid cloud storage service that connects your on-premises applications to AWS storage. It provides low-latency access to data by caching frequently used data on-premises while storing the full dataset securely in S3.
