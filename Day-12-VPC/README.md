## Day 12: Building Your Virtual Datacenter - VPC Fundamentals üöÄ

> **Today's Focus:** Understanding the foundational building blocks of AWS networking by creating a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) from the ground up.

### üí° What I Learned

Today's session was all about creating a secure and isolated network environment in AWS. I learned how all the core components of a VPC work together.

#### The Foundation & Structure

-   **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** This is your own logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. It's a virtual network that you define and control, where you can launch your AWS resources.
-   **CIDR Blocks:** A VPC is defined by a private IP address range using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`). This block provides the pool of IP addresses for all resources within the VPC.
-   **Subnets:** These are smaller IP address ranges carved out from the main VPC CIDR block. Subnets are tied to a single Availability Zone and are where you place your resources like EC2 instances. They can be configured as either public or private.

#### Connectivity & Routing

-   **Internet Gateway (IGW):** A horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It's the "front door" for public traffic.
-   **Route Tables:** A set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet is directed. A subnet with a route to the IGW (`0.0.0.0/0 -> igw-xxxx`) is a **public subnet**.
-   **NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation):** A managed AWS service that enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. It provides secure, outbound-only internet access for private resources.

#### Security Layers

-   **Security Groups (SGs):** A virtual firewall for your **instances**. They control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. SGs are **stateful** ‚Äì if you allow an incoming request, the outgoing response is automatically allowed, regardless of outbound rules.
-   **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):** A firewall for your **subnets**. They control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level, acting as an additional layer of defense. NACLs are **stateless** ‚Äì you must explicitly define rules for both inbound and outbound traffic.

### üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Lab

1.  Created a custom **VPC** with a `/16` CIDR block.
2.  Set up two subnets: a **Public Subnet** and a **Private Subnet**, each with a `/24` CIDR block in different Availability Zones.
3.  Attached an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** to the VPC to enable internet access.
4.  Configured the **Route Table** associated with the public subnet to direct internet-bound traffic (`0.0.0.0/0`) to the IGW.
5.  Launched a "Web Server" EC2 instance into the Public Subnet, assigning it a **Security Group** that allowed inbound HTTP (Port 80) and SSH (Port 22) traffic from my IP.
6.  Launched a "Database Server" EC2 instance into the Private Subnet with a different **Security Group** allowing inbound MySQL (Port 3306) traffic *only* from the Web Server's security group. This effectively isolated the database from the public internet.

### ‚ú® Key Takeaway

A VPC is the non-negotiable foundation of security and architecture on AWS. Properly configuring its components‚Äîsubnets for isolation, route tables for traffic flow, and layers of security with SGs and NACLs‚Äîis the first and most critical step in building any secure, scalable, and well-architected cloud application.
