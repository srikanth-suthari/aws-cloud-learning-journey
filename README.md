My personal notes and projects from learning AWS cloud computing fundamentals.

# My AWS Cloud Learning Journey ðŸš€

Excited to share my foundational learning in cloud computing! This repository serves as a personal knowledge base, documenting my progress and understanding of core cloud concepts and AWS services.

## I. Core Cloud Computing Concepts (General to any Cloud Provider)

### What is Cloud Computing

On-demand delivery of IT resources like Compute Power, Storage, Databases, and applications via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Image Suggestion:** A general cloud computing concept image (like the one generated previously).

### Key Characteristics:

* **On-demand self-service:** Provision resources without human interaction.
* **Broad network access:** Accessible over the internet from various devices.
* **Resource pooling:** Multi-tenant model where resources are dynamically assigned.
* **Rapid elasticity:** Scale up or down quickly based on demand.
* **Measured service:** Pay only for what you use.

**Image Suggestion:** Consider a single infographic-style image summarizing these characteristics, or separate small icons next to each point.

### Cloud Service Models:

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides basic computing infrastructure (virtual machines, networks, storage). We manage the OS and applications. (e.g., AWS EC2)
    * **Image Suggestion:** An image showing servers/VMs as building blocks.
* **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure associated with developing and launching an app. (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda for serverless)
    * **Image Suggestion:** An image showing a platform with tools for developers.
* **Software as a Service (SaaS):** A complete, ready-to-use application managed by the provider. We only use it. (e.g., Gmail, Netflix and Spotify etc.)
    * **Image Suggestion:** An image showing a ready-to-use application icon.

### Cloud Deployment Models:

* **Public Cloud:** Cloud services offered by third-party providers over the public internet (e.g., AWS).
    * **Image Suggestion:** A cloud icon with many users accessing it.
* **Private Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure operated exclusively for a single organization.
    * **Image Suggestion:** A cloud icon within a private network boundary.
* **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
    * **Image Suggestion:** Two cloud icons (public and private) connected.

## II. AWS Global Infrastructure

### Regions:

Geographic areas where AWS clusters its data centers. Designed to be isolated from each other to ensure fault tolerance and stability.

**Image Suggestion:** A world map highlighting AWS regions.

### Availability Zones (AZs):

Isolated locations within a Region. Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. This design allows for high availability and disaster recovery.

**Image Suggestion:** A diagram showing a region with multiple interconnected AZs.

### Edge Locations (or AWS Local Zones/Outposts):

Data centers designed to deliver content with low latency to users by caching it closer to them.

**Image Suggestion:** A diagram showing content flowing from AWS to users via edge locations.
